## Introduction

The Smart Product Re-Ranking system is a lightweight recommendation and ranking system that learns which products should appear higher in search results based on customer behavior and sales data. The system simulates an e-commerce platform's internal analytics team improving its search algorithm by using SQL for raw behavioral data extraction and Python with machine learning for analysis and ranking predictions.

## Glossary

- **Smart_Product_Reranking_System**: The complete system that processes customer behavior data and generates relevance scores for product ranking
- **Relevance_Score**: A numerical value (0-1) that indicates how likely a product is to perform well in search results
- **CTR**: Click-through rate calculated as clicks divided by impressions
- **CVR**: Conversion rate calculated as purchases divided by clicks
- **High_Performing_Product**: A product classified as performing above the sales quantile threshold
- **MySQL_Database**: The relational database storing product, user behavior, and inventory data
- **ML_Model**: The machine learning model (Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting) that predicts product performance
- **Feature_Engineering_Module**: The Python component that transforms raw data into ML-ready features
- **A_B_Simulation**: A comparison test between old ranking (by rating) and new ranking (by predicted score)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to extract and aggregate customer behavior metrics from the database, so that I can understand product performance patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes user search data, THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL calculate CTR as clicks divided by impressions for each product
2. WHEN the system processes purchase data, THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL calculate CVR as purchases divided by clicks for each product
3. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL aggregate cart-to-purchase ratios for each product
4. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL extract product metrics including category, price, rating, and discount information
5. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL store aggregated metrics in a format suitable for machine learning processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to engineer features from raw data, so that I can train an effective product ranking model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing product data, THE Feature_Engineering_Module SHALL create discount percentage features from price and discount data
2. WHEN processing product data, THE Feature_Engineering_Module SHALL create price bucket categories for products
3. WHEN processing product data, THE Feature_Engineering_Module SHALL create rating bucket categories for products
4. THE Feature_Engineering_Module SHALL combine seller rating with stock availability to create composite features
5. THE Feature_Engineering_Module SHALL merge behavioral metrics (CTR, CVR) with product attributes using product identifiers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to train a model that predicts product performance, so that I can generate relevance scores for search ranking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ML_Model SHALL classify products as High_Performing_Product or low-performing based on sales quantiles
2. WHEN training the model, THE ML_Model SHALL use Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting algorithms
3. WHEN making predictions, THE ML_Model SHALL output probability scores that serve as Relevance_Score values
4. THE ML_Model SHALL achieve a minimum ROC-AUC score of 0.7 for model validation
5. THE ML_Model SHALL provide feature importance rankings to identify key ranking factors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to evaluate the effectiveness of the new ranking system, so that I can make informed decisions about implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL calculate ROC-AUC, Precision, and Recall metrics for model evaluation
2. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL generate visualizations showing top features driving product ranking
3. WHEN running A_B_Simulation, THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL compare old ranking (by rating) with new ranking (by predicted score)
4. THE A_B_Simulation SHALL measure and report average purchase rate differences between ranking methods
5. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL generate insights report showing quantified improvements in ranking precision

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete system with database schema and analysis tools, so that I can deploy and maintain the ranking system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE MySQL_Database SHALL contain tables for products, user_searches, and inventory with appropriate relationships
2. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL provide SQL scripts for table creation and sample data insertion
3. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL include feature extraction queries for data aggregation
4. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL provide a complete Python workflow including EDA, ML training, and evaluation
5. THE Smart_Product_Reranking_System SHALL generate a concise insights report with quantified business impact metrics
