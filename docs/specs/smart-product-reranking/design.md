# Smart Product Re-Ranking System Design

## Overview

The Smart Product Re-Ranking system is designed as a modular, data-driven solution that processes e-commerce behavioral event data from CSV files to generate intelligent product rankings. The system follows a pipeline architecture with distinct phases: CSV data loading and processing (Pandas), feature engineering (Python/Pandas), machine learning modeling (Scikit-Learn), and evaluation/simulation.

The system architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, with clear interfaces between the data loading layer, feature engineering layer, and machine learning layer. The primary data source is an events.csv file containing user behavioral data with columns: timestamp, visitorid, event, itemid, and transactionid.

### Component Interaction Flow

1. **Data Loading**: CSV reader loads events.csv and validates data structure
2. **Event Processing**: Python modules aggregate behavioral events by item and visitor
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transform event data into ML-ready features (CTR, conversion rates, etc.)
4. **Model Training**: Scikit-Learn algorithms train on engineered features
5. **Prediction**: Trained model generates relevance scores for products
6. **Evaluation**: A/B simulation compares ranking methods and generates insights

## Components and Interfaces

```python
# Event Data Model
@dataclass
class Event:
    timestamp: int
    visitorid: int
    event: str  # 'view', 'addtocart', 'transaction'
    itemid: int
    transactionid: Optional[str]

# Behavioral Metrics Model

    transaction_count: int
    unique_visitors: int
    addtocart_rate: float  # addtocart/view

    cart_conversion_rate: float  # transaction/addtocart

# Feature Vector Model

### CSV Data Structure

The system processes event data from a CSV file with the following structure:

```csv
timestamp,visitorid,event,itemid,transactionid
1433221332117,257597,view,355908,
1433224214164,992329,view,248676,
1433221999827,111016,addtocart,318965,
1433221955914,483717,transaction,253185,12345
```

**Field Descriptions**:

- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp (milliseconds) when the event occurred
- `visitorid`: Unique identifier for the visitor/user
- `event`: Event type - 'view', 'addtocart', or 'transaction'
- `itemid`: Unique identifier for the product/item
- `transactionid`: Transaction ID (only populated for 'transaction' events)

**Data Processing Pipeline**:

1. Load CSV using pandas with appropriate data types
2. Convert timestamp to datetime for temporal analysis
3. Group events by itemid to calculate behavioral metrics
4. Generate features for machine learning model training

## Error Handling

### Data Quality Validation

- **Missing Data**: Implement null value handling with configurable strategies (mean imputation, exclusion)
- **Data Type Validation**: Ensure numeric fields are properly typed and within expected ranges
- **Referential Integrity**: Validate foreign key relationships between tables

### Model Training Errors

- **Insufficient Data**: Minimum threshold checks for training data volume
- **Model Convergence**: Timeout and iteration limits for training algorithms
- **Feature Correlation**: Detection and handling of highly correlated features

### Runtime Error Handling

- **Database Connection**: Retry logic with exponential backoff for connection failures
- **Memory Management**: Chunked processing for large datasets
- **Model Loading**: Graceful fallback to default ranking when model unavailable

### Logging Strategy

```python
# Structured logging for monitoring and debugging
logger.info("Feature engineering completed", extra={
    "num_products": len(products),
    "num_features": feature_matrix.shape[1],
    "processing_time": elapsed_time
